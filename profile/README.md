## Welcome to the Terra Isles RP Community

Terra Isles Roleplay has been serving the public since the 1st of January 2017. Our approach to a realistic and professional roleplaying environment is a combined goal of the Community, along with maintaining a family-orientated community all with a love for gaming. Terra Isles RP strives to achieve these tasks by having a community of gamers and modders, as well as real-life military, law enforcement, healthcare professionals and first responders, who believe in a respectful and mature environment where we can build a willingness to learn and better ourselves along with our surroundings. 



Our mission is to provide an authentic, mature, realistic and true-to-form roleplaying experience, while simultaneously delivering an enjoyable environment for all members. The community bases itself within the fictional Grand Theft Auto island of San Andreas with influences from; Australia, Canada and the United States of America. 



To ensure the highest quality of roleplay, the community has always been whitelisted. This means that all of our members have submitted an application, undergone an interview, and been approved into the community, if you think you have what it takes, click here and follow the application instructions.



Upon applying to the Community, prospective members will automatically join as civilians responsible for orchestrating a lively society. Our members develop and maintain our roleplay society through their Character's Background Stories in an environment with unlimited opportunities for criminal enterprises or playing big within civilian businesses.

If you are not able to acquire a computer and/or a legitimate copy of Grand Theft Auto V then we encourage you to pursue a career within the Operational Communications Centre (OCC) for the same sense of achievement. This allows for members without the capabilities of being able join an in-game role to pursue a vital and ever-evolving career within the Operational Communications Centre (OCC). This allows us to thrive in an atmosphere of friendship and experience. If you are concerned or are confused contact the Department of Recruitment and Field Training Staff at our email address: Recruitment@Terra-Isles.com or contact us via our Public Affairs and Media Relations Discord, here.



The Community adheres to an age limit to help maintain our goals for success. Person(s) aged fifteen (15) and above are allowed to submit and eligible for Membership.



On behalf of Terra Isles Roleplay and our Administrators, we thank future applicants for taking the time and effort it takes to thrive and dedicate themselves to the TRP and the goals set to bring us forward to the future.



Sincerely,



Executive Board of Directors

Director Noah F, Deputy Director Erving Q, Assistant Deputy Director Tristian R.

Courage, Initiative, Integrity, Professionalism, Accountability, Respect
